# path-finding-visualizer

This project is a path finding visualizer created using react. The gui can be used to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. You can check it out and play around with it over hear: http://mihirsp18.github.io/path-finding-visualizer

This application supports the following Pathfinding algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm
A* Algorithm
Greedy Best First Search
Bidirectional Greedy Search
Also supports the following Maze Generation algorithms:

Random Maze
Recursive Division Maze
Vertical Division Maze
Horizontal Division Maze
