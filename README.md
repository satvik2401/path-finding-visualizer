# path-finding-visualizer

This project is a path finding visualizer created using react. The gui can be used to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. You can check it out and play around with it over hear: http://mihirsp18.github.io/path-finding-visualizer

This application supports the following Pathfinding algorithms:
  1.Dijkstra's Algorithm
  2.A* Algorithm
  3.Greedy Best First Search
  4.Bidirectional Greedy Search

Also supports the following Maze Generation algorithms:
  1.Random Maze
  2.Recursive Division Maze
  3.Vertical Division Maze
  4.Horizontal Division Maze
